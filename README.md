# How to Use 
run.py is an example of code to run the decision tree classifier.  If running on your own dataset, the only 2 required methods are fit() and predict().

Demo_tree is for demonstration purposes only.  It breaks down the step-by-step approach that the decision tree makes along the way to build the decision tree algorithm, and print out the features along the way.  It should not be used for classification because the print statements will slow down the model significantly.
